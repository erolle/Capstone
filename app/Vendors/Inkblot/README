This is a simple project to allow someone to create a procedurally generated
Rorschach inkblot using JavaScript on a browser that supports HTML5 and more
specifically, the canvas tag.

Included are two files:

  * rorschach.js
  * rorschach.html
  
The rorschach.html file will allow you to quickly generate a Rorschach inkblot
in your browser (tested with Google Chrome).

This rorschach.html file references the rorschach.js file that contains the guts
of the inkblot painting.

You can use this rorschach.js file however you want.  You don't need to credit
me in any way.

For example you can use it to add client-side processed Rorschach inkblots to
your web page.

Have fun!
