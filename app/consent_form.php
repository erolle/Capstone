        <h4>INFORMED CONSENT FORM</h4>

        <h2>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:</h2>
        <p>
        Erroyl E. Rolle, Principal Investigator <br>

        <h3>INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>You are invited to participate in a usability study. This study focuses on the advancement of computer security systems, specifically to promote the use of passwords that are sufficiently strong, yet user-friendly. This is an iterative study that will take place over the course of four weeks, however only requires you to complete three multiple-choice surveys with the anticipation that each survey will take about 10 minutes of your time.
        The data collected will remain confidential. We will not collect or store your existing password for this study, or use any personally identifiable information for the analysis portion of this study such as your email, user name, or given name. The research will not be associated with individual participants under their registered identities from CausBuzz.com.
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to improve the system being tested, and is not a test of your performance.  If you do not wish to participate, you may decline the invitation. If you do wish to participate, please read this informed consent and click the “Agree” link below.
        </p>

        <h3>RISKS</h3>
        <p>The risks involved are minimal and do not exceed the risks within day-to-day internet use. As with other sites, if your password is stolen or guessed by an attacker, your information can be compromised. However measures are already in place in order to protect you under your current registration and utilization of CausBuzz.com.
        </p>
        <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
        <p></p>The knowledge gained from the findings of this study can benefit future password systems designs for greater ease of use, effectiveness and user satisfaction.

        <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
        <p>The information in the study records will be kept strictly confidential. Data will be stored securely and will be made available only to persons conducting the study unless you specifically give permission in writing to do otherwise. Information for this study will be held in a database separate from the CausBuzz.com database, and only data pertaining to the study will be stored in this database. No reference will be made in oral or written reports, which could link you to the study. Publications related to this work will not make reference to any individuals.
        </p>
        <p>At the completion of this study, the research database will be deleted and the research data will be encrypted and stored on a removable drive and kept in a lock box offline.
        </p>

        <h3>CONTACT</h3>
        <p>If you have questions at any time about the study or the procedures, you may contact the researcher, Erroyl Rolle, GCCIS, Information Sciences and Technologies Department, Human Computer Interaction at RIT via e-mail: eer6344@rit.edu or Heather M. Foti, Human Subjects Research Office (HSRO) at RIT via e-mail: hmfsrs@rit.edu.
