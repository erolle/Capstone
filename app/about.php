<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this digital age, people are relying more on web technologies to store secure information, such as credit card numbers. The more difficult it is to remember a secure password, the more likely it will be for users to fall back on less secure and easier to remember passwords. In this proposal the current state of the user experience for password security will be described, the problem space will be identified, and a proposed system for overcoming significant barriers to security will be explored.</p>
